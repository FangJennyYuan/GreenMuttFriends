## Overview

Every child deserves a healthy start. Neonatal jaundice occurs in more than 60% of newborns during their first weeks of life. When properly diagnosed, phototherapy can rapidly reduce high bilirubin levels, an indicator of jaundice, and prevent kernicterus, a chronic neurologic disorder. Currently Dr. Wennberg, who invented low-cost test strips that diagnose bilirubin levels, is working with Seattle University Capstone Students to develop an Android application that analyzes the test strips.  When the mobile app is launched, how will anyone know whether it has actually helped more children get a healthy start? 

Our solution is this reporting system which measures the app's impact and brings visibility to the mission of saving children.  This system collects app data and features a dashboard full of reports that analyze the performance, impact, and adoption of the application. It reports on device data like camera quality, device type, and OS, that could impact the diagnostic results. Photo errors related to a particular device and location are highlighted on the dashboard so that administrators can contact clinics to address user issues immediately.  Additionally, the reports give a snapshot of app usage trends like the number of installs or launches and include the option to drill down on details like the time of day or clinic location.
